There Are Two Versions, A Temperature Sensor Enclosure With Venting Designed To Be Stuck Down And A Bolt/Screw Mountable Version With Cutouts For Access To Pins.  The Tops And Bottoms Are Interchangable And There Is A THT Or SMD Version Depending On Which Side Of The Board You Use.

I Have Managed To Fit A Coin Cell And A 433Mhz Transmitter Inside The SMD "Temp" Version.
